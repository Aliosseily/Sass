// function are kind of mixins but they are very different as well.
// mixins will give us a load of different properties or group them together and also taking
// arguments for those properties.
// A function instead will return a single value, it might take in an argument, it might do
// some manipulation with that and at the end it returns a single value which we can sometimes
// use for properties.
